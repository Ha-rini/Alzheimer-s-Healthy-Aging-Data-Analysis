# Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Data Analysis

This project analyzes the **CDC's Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging dataset** to uncover key insights about health trends, disparities, and risks among older adults in the United States.  
The project was developed as part of our **Visual Analytics coursework**.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**:  
  To explore health indicators related to aging populations, identify trends, and create dashboards that reveal regional and demographic disparities.  

- **Dataset**:  
  CDC's [Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alzheimers-disease-and-healthy-aging-data) (state-level, multi-year health indicators).  

- **Tool Used**:  
  - Tableau (for data visualization & dashboards)  
  - Preprocessing in Python / Excel (data cleaning & preparation)

---

## Key Features
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracked changes in health indicators (mental distress, chronic diseases, cognitive decline) over time.  
- **Geographic Disparities**: Created state-level and regional heatmaps to identify high-risk areas.  
- **Demographic Insights**: Compared health metrics by **age group, gender, and race/ethnicity**.  
- **Health Risk Index**: Designed a composite index combining confidence intervals with metric values to measure reliability of health outcomes.  
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Built dashboards in Tableau for easy stakeholder exploration.

## Future Enhancements
- Automate dataset updates from CDC via API.  
- Integrate dashboards into a Flask/Streamlit web app for broader access.  
- Extend analysis to global datasets for comparison.
